Welcome to my blog that takes you through the proof's of algorithms that I have used or come across through my studies and/or work. 
My intent is to myself gain a deeper understanding by helping others learn. 
So I hope that these algorithms will be demystified either through my explanations or through the code implementations. 
Please share this if you do think it is helpful and don't hesitate to reach out if you have questions, comments, or concerns.
